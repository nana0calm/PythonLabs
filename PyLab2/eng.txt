Multimedia applications are used in all sorts of fields. For example, museums, banks and estate agents often have information kiosks that use multimedia; companies produce training programs on optical discs; businesspeople use Microsoft PowerPoint to create slideshows; and teachers use multimedia to make video projects or to teach subjects like art and music. They have all found that moving images and sound can involve viewers emotionally as well as inform them, helping make their message more memorable.
